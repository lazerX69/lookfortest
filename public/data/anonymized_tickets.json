I have been using NATPAT for several years without any issues, but the MagicPatch Itch Relief Patches I received seem to be the old version and the packaging is different than what is advertised on the website. I have attached a photo of the packaging I received for all 8 packs of the MagicPatch Itch Relief Patches that I received in my order versus the one on the website. The ones I received state that there are 27 patches, while the website states there are 32 patches in each pack. The shape of the patches are different as well- I recall the ones I have are the style that was originally offered years ago.   The most glaring issue is the performance and staying power of the patches I received. They fall off almost immediately and are guaranteed gone after sleeping. In the past, the patches would stay on for several days even with swimming, showering, and regular daily activities.  Overall, I'm displeased with the patches I received and I would like to get them replaced with the new version that are advertised on the website.  Thank you, Jan Heyrana --  Jan Q. Heyrana, M.Ed. | AMI Certified Primary Guide\" Agent's message: \"Hi Jan,Thanks for reaching out and sharing your experience with the MagicPatch Itch Relief Patches. I’m sorry to hear they aren’t sticking well for you—that’s definitely frustrating!The new packaging and updated patch design you see on our website aren’t available yet in the US or Canada (they’re currently only available in Australia). We expect to have the new version implemented in the US within 4-6 weeks.If you’d like, I can send you 2 free packs of the current version to make up for the inconvenience. Just let me know!\""
